The website lists about 8 false positives that were identified, which makes cases lower today than in the past week. An earlier verison of this spreadsheet included testing figures for jails and juvenile facilities. For consistency with other states, we've limited the numbers to prisons and work release centers. Until early November, West Virginia’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation reported staff cases for juvenile facilities and jails combined with prisons and work release. After they began providing itemized numbers on staff cases on Nov. 3, we only included staff numbers from prisons and work release sites in our data releases. In our online tracker, we have gone back to the past weeks of data and estimated the staff breakdown based on the overall size of the staff for each sector."
